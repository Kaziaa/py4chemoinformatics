== Chapter 1: Introduction
:imagesdir: ./images

Chemoinformatics is a methodology that is used to analyze mainly chemical-related data using a computer and solve various problems. The term chemoinformatics was defined in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and in the pharmaceutical industry and pharmaceutical academia, the relationship between drug effects and compound characteristics is analyzed, large amounts of compound information are visualized, and compound similarity It is used in a wide variety of processes, including gender-based clustering.

In recent years, drug discovery applications for deep learning have been explored, but not only in conventional chemoinformatics such as **new design proposals** and **synthetic route proposals**, as well as QSAR (Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship) for predicting activity and physical properties. Applied research to areas that were not being conducted is also actively conducted.


Compound design is innovative

****
What kind of compound should we make in the first place? And how to synthesize it? The process of thinking about the background is an area where background knowledge and imagination are required, and conventionally it has been recognized that it is a difficult area for people other than to bear, but the advancement of what is also called AI to such areas is here It progressed rapidly in several years (2017-2019).

Cheminformatics has already been used in various situations, but there was not much relevant information. There are several possible reasons for this, but there is no doubt that the two main reasons are that there were no open source toolkits and no public databases. However, with the advent of RDKit, an open source chemoinformatics toolkit called ChKit and a public database called ChEMBL, this has been resolved.

In recent years, as with bioinformatics in chemoinformatics, a lot of information can be obtained immediately by searching on the web, and it is possible to learn by yourself, but as a set of information to take a first step, We decided to prepare "the content that could learn the basics of chemoinformatics and apply them". Considering the recent AI drug discovery boom, the latter chapter contains chapters on compound activity prediction and compound proposal using deep learning used in the context of “AI drug discovery”, so one-stop learning So you should be able to keep up with the recent trends.

=== What is RDKit

warning:: Here is a subsection of @ iwatobipen's talk about RDKit. At the draft stage, the words such as "I will say" or "based on" are used as they are, and the self-proclaimed is a "comprehensive" @ iwatobipen-style style of "gozuru" tone.

My name is @iwatobipen, who writes a part of this book. I'm going to talk hot about RDKit here.

What is the RD of RDKit? Actually, it is an abbreviation of **Rational Discovery** , and a framework that is the predecessor of the current open source was developed in 2000. It's so old and old. Then, in 2006, the code became open source and was released from sourceforge. Readers who think that Python's chemoinformatics toolkit includes OpenBabel besides RDKit will also be welcome. OpenBabel was first released in 2005. All come with a toolkit that has more than 10 years of history. I remember that OpenBabel was the major in around 2012, when the deaf people began to be interested in this area. At that time, there were almost no articles in Japanese, and the person who wrote this link:https://kzfm.hatenablog.com/archive[book] was a trial and error writing the code of RDKit referring to the link:https://kzfm.hatenablog.com/archive[chemo info] cookbook of @fmkz___ who is a co-
author of this book and a pioneer in the industry Oh. If you want to keep track of chemiinfo related history, you should read this link:http://blog.kzfmix.com/entry/1542711744[article].


Developer Greg Landorum says

[quote, Greg Landorum]
RDKit is the Swiss Army Knife in chemoinformatics and is a collection of various functional pieces

This is exactly the expression which got the target. As you can see if you look at the link:link:https://www.rdkit.org/docs/[official document] , it already has various features. Starting with reading and writing of compound information, drawing of structure, 3D structure conformation generation, R group decomposition, descriptor, fingerprint calculation, pharmacophore calculation etc. Oh. It can cover a wide range from analysis to visualization. Furthermore, the tools developed by Contributor and others using RDKit are packed in the link:https://github.com/rdkit/rdkit/tree/master/Contrib[Contrib] folder along with their hot feelings . How do you want to use it? . The deaf people are getting tired of touching RDKit as soon as possible.

NOTE: @iwatobipen is, of course, one of the contributors, and provides code to quickly cluster a large number of compound libraries called link:https://github.com/rdkit/rdkit/tree/master/Contrib/Fastcluster[Fastcluster] . (by @fmkz___)

RDKit is also active in the development and user community, with more features being added. The style in which talented researchers from all over the world build up and develop as a whole is the strength and attraction of open source. If you have a chance, consider joining the annual RDKit User Group Meeting. It is hard to replace anything with Face2Face that users can discuss each other. In addition, I said that there was almost no information on Japanese at the time when the deaf began to use it, but in recent years there have been a lot of very good Japanese articles. Here are a few examples: There are many articles posted on Qiita.

In addition, link:http://rdkit-users.jp/[RDKit-users-jp] by volunteers has also been launched. If your question in English seems to be a bit ..., I would like to ask a question here. Also, Japanese documents are merged into the latest version of RDKit's repository. This will also be helpful. This document only uses some of RDKit's features. You should still feel that you can do a lot of things. Once you have taken the first step of interest, you should go ahead with your own interest and motivation. If you do not understand something, ask the above community and post it to the repository of this book as an issue. **Well then let's get started!**

=== Target audience

The following people are assumed as readers.

- Postdoctoral student who wants to do data analysis of graduate students in pharmacy and medicine and pharmacy
- Pharmacist at a pharmaceutical company who wants to analyze his own data
- Those who feel the need for chemoinformatics in drug discovery chemists and those who are assigned suddenly due to the power of mystery
- Bioinformaticians who are thinking of learning chemoinformatics
- People who are interested in AI drug discovery but do not know what to start with

=== About the code of this book

All of the programming code used in this book is located in the notebooks directory of the link:https://github.com/Mishima-syk/py4chemoinformatics[py4cheminformatics repository of Mishima.syk]. The first one of each of the image:jupyter.png[width="20"] chapter please see properly because it stretched a link to the chapter of Jupyter notebook to.

The installation of Chapter 2 will enable you to use git commands, so you can download all the data in this manual including pdf with the following command

.Chemoinformatics or Cheminformatics?

Chemoinformatics or Cheminformatics?
Originally I remember that Bio and the combination of the word “Chemo” appeared, but it was widely separated from Chem for a while by the launch of the link:https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/[Journal of Cheminformatics].

According to the recent link:https://trends.google.co.jp/trends/explore?date=all&q=chemoinformatics,cheminformatics[Google trend], it seems either way, but personally I think that it is better to put emphasis on Rhyme, so I will use Chemo in this book.

From here onwards I wrote while listening to Nujabes-reflection eternal by @fmkz___ 20/03/20

まず、本書を書くきっかけとなったlink:https://twitter.com/bonohu[@bonohu]に感謝したいと思います。@bonohuのlink:https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4895929019[Dr. Bonoの生命科学データ解析]の出版後のMishima.sykのミーティングで「Bono本のChemoinformatics版あったらいいよね」という話がどこからともなくでた際に、「書けばええんちゃう、むしろなんで書かんの？」と言ってくれたことが本書を執筆するきっかけであることは間違いありません。またlink:https://twitter.com/souyakuchan[@souyakuchan]のlink:https://adventar.org/calendars/3041[創薬 Advent Calendar 2018]も執筆のいい刺激になりました。というより、ここで章立てしなかったら具体的に動き出さなかったと思います。

また、忘れてはいけないのはy-samaの存在です。link:http://mishima-syk.github.io/[Mishima.syk]を初期から盛り上げてきたy-samaは2019/01/06に永眠しました。彼はlink:https://qiita.com/y\__sama/items/5b62d31cb7e6ed50f02c[データサイエンティストを目指す人のpython環境構築 2016]やlink:https://medium.com/@y__sama/druglikeness%E3%81%AB%E3%81%A4%E3%81%84%E3%81%A6%E3%81%AE%E3%82%88%E3%82%82%E3%82%84%E3%81%BE%E8%A9%B1-8310cec5ffc6[Druglikenessについてのよもやま話]といった素晴らしいエントリを残しました。彼が存命であればきっと3人で執筆していたし、内容ももっと充実していたことでしょう。この出来事も我々に執筆しようという強い動機を与えました。

最後にMishima.sykに参加して美味しいワインやビールを飲みなから毎度熱い議論を交わしていただいた参加者の方々にも感謝します。いくつかのコンテンツはMishima.sykでの発表をもとにしており、みなさんのフィードバックをもとに加筆訂正してあります。

もし、本書を読んで、ケモインフォマティクスって面白いなと感じたり、創薬やってみたいなと感じる方がいたら、是非Mishima.sykに参加してみてください。きっと楽しいと思います。今後の創薬研究では所属を超えてお互いにプッシュしあって自身のスキルを高めていくことが重要になるでしょう。というより、既にそういう社会になっているのだと思います。本書が皆さんの楽しい研究生活を送る役に立てば幸いです。

[quote, y__sama]
やりたいことをやって生きてきて 私自身は自分の人生に後悔はありません
人生は楽しんだもの勝ち
皆さんも嫌なことは嫌だと言って自分の喜びを最大限に追い求めて人生を満喫した方が楽しいと思いますよ
皆様の人生に幸多い事を願っています
